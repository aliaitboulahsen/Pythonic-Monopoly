# Unit 6 - Pythonic Monopoly

## Background
Harold's company has just started a new Real Estate Investment division to provide customers with a broader range of portfolio options. Harold was tasked with building a prototype dashboard, and he needs your help. The real estate team wants to trial this initial offering with investment opportunities for the Toronto market. If the new service is popular, then they can start to expand to other markets.
This dashboard's goal is to provide charts, maps, and interactive visualizations that help customers explore the data and determine if they want to invest in rental properties in Toronto.

## We will run the analysis based on the following steps:
- Rental Analysis
- Dwelling Types Per Year
- Average Monthly Shelter Costs in Toronto Per Year
- Average House Value per Year
- Average Prices By Neighbourhood
- Number of Dwelling Types per Year
- Top 10 Most Expensive Neighbourhoods
- Neighbourhood Map

We will finish this analysis by putting all of our plots in a single dashboard for convenience and allow the Real Eastate Investment division to make decisions.
